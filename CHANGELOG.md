## [3.3.3] - 2025-11-07

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes: WSL Audio & Hooks Format

This release fixes two critical issues affecting WSL users and new installations.

### Fixed

#### 1. WSL Audio Playback Issue
- **Problem**: Windows MediaPlayer could not access audio files via WSL UNC paths (`\\wsl.localhost\...`)
- **Solution**: Audio files are now copied to Windows temp directory (`C:/Windows/Temp`) before playback
- **Impact**: WSL users can now hear audio notifications correctly
- **Technical Details**:
  - Modified `play_audio_internal()` in `hooks/shared/hook_config.sh`
  - Automatic cleanup after playback completes
  - Increased playback wait time from 3s to 4s for reliability
  - Background process handles file cleanup to avoid blocking

#### 2. Hooks Format Compatibility (Credits: @PaddyPatPat)
- **Problem**: Installer generated deprecated hooks format, causing Claude Code v2.0.32+ to report "Invalid Settings"
- **Solution**: Updated installer to generate new array-based format required by Claude Code v2.0.32+
- **Impact**: New installations now work correctly with latest Claude Code
- **Technical Details**:
  - Modified `scripts/install-complete.sh` Python script
  - Old format: `"Notification": "~/.claude/hooks/notification_hook.sh"`
  - New format: `"Notification": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/notification_hook.sh"}]}]`
  - Each hook now formatted as array of matcher objects

### Cross-Platform Status
- ✅ **WSL users**: Both audio playback and hooks format fixed
- ✅ **macOS users**: No changes (continues using afplay)
- ✅ **Linux users**: No changes (continues using mpg123/aplay)
- ✅ **Git Bash users**: No changes (already working)

### Upgrade Instructions

**For existing installations:**
```bash
cd claude-code-audio-hooks
git pull origin master

# Update hook audio playback
cp hooks/shared/hook_config.sh ~/.claude/hooks/shared/hook_config.sh

# Re-run installer to update hooks format
bash scripts/install-complete.sh
```

### Credits
- WSL audio fix: Main development team
- Hooks format fix: Special thanks to [@PaddyPatPat](https://github.com/PaddyPatPat) for identifying and documenting the hooks format issue in [PR #2](https://github.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks/pull/2)

## [3.3.2] - 2025-11-07

### Note
This version was superseded by v3.3.3 which includes additional hooks format fix. Please upgrade to v3.3.3.

## [3.3.1] - 2025-11-06

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes: Installation Script Stability

Fixed critical issues preventing successful installation on WSL and other platforms.

### Fixed
- **Bash arithmetic expression error with `set -e`**:
  - Replaced post-increment operators (`++`) with compound assignment (`+=1`)
  - Post-increment returns 0 when variable is 0, causing `set -e` to exit
  - Affected counters: `STEPS_COMPLETED`, `WARNINGS`, `ERRORS`, and all test counters
  - Installation now completes successfully on all platforms

- **Python type error in configuration validation**:
  - Fixed `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'`
  - Configuration validation now filters out comment keys (starting with `_`)
  - Properly handles JSON files with inline comments

### Impact
- ✅ **Installation now works reliably on WSL**
- ✅ **All arithmetic operations safe with `set -e`**
- ✅ **Configuration validation handles commented JSON**
- ✅ **No breaking changes** - fully backward compatible

### Technical Details
```bash
# Before (fails with set -e when var=0)
((STEPS_COMPLETED++))

# After (works correctly)
((STEPS_COMPLETED+=1))
```

## [3.3.0] - 2025-11-06

```bash
# Check if notification hook is enabled
bash scripts/configure.sh --get notification

# Enable multiple hooks at once
bash scripts/configure.sh --enable notification stop subagent_stop

# Mixed operations in one command
bash scripts/configure.sh --enable notification --disable pretooluse
```
