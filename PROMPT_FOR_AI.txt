I need you to help me install Claude Code Audio Hooks, a tool that plays audio notifications when Claude Code finishes responding.

CONTEXT:
- Repository: https://github.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks
- This adds audio notifications to Claude Code CLI
- Works on Windows (WSL), Linux, and macOS (with modifications)
- Requires: Claude Code CLI already installed

INSTALLATION STEPS - Please execute these for me:

1. First, verify Claude Code is installed:
   - Run: claude --version
   - If not installed, inform me and provide the download link: https://claude.ai/download

2. Clone the repository to my home directory:
   - cd ~
   - git clone https://github.com/ChanMeng666/claude-code-audio-hooks.git
   - cd claude-code-audio-hooks

3. Make the installation script executable and run it:
   - chmod +x install.sh
   - ./install.sh

4. After installation, run the verification script:
   - chmod +x check-setup.sh
   - ./check-setup.sh

5. Test the audio notification:
   - chmod +x test-audio.sh
   - ./test-audio.sh

6. Inform me that I need to restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect.

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR YOU (AI):
- If any command fails, explain what went wrong and suggest solutions
- Check the output of check-setup.sh and help fix any issues
- If I'm on macOS, inform me I need to modify hooks/play_audio.sh to use 'afplay' instead of PowerShell
- If I'm on native Linux (not WSL), inform me I may need to install mpg123 for audio playback

After completing these steps, ask me if I heard the audio notification and if I need help customizing the sound.
